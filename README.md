Project Overview Summary: An all-in-one business-accounting app that allows business owners to interact with their accountant, organize their monthly paperwork, calculate their estimated sales tax fees, and compute their employee’s net pay.

-The idea of this app was originally suggested by Fadi Nakkoud. Fadi has been an Accountant for almost 5 years now. Fadi really enjoys his job. However, he wanted to find a way to get rid of all the hassles in his work field and provide a user friendly-interactive platform for his clients and find a solution to all their bookkeeping problems. Some of those bookkeeping solutions include increasing organization skills, avoiding late penalty tax fees, stop relying on mail delivery services, understanding and recognizing their monthly sales tax fees, and calculating their employee’s net pay checks.

-Bookkeeping King will have two types of users:
Accountant: will have full access to all the apps features and additional access to specific properties such as their company’s default information, inventory, important deadlines, and tax rates.
Business Owner: will have full access to all the apps features such as importing check-cash invoices and expense bills, manually importing monthly revenue sales and all invoice totals, conducting an estimate of sales tax fees, and calculating all employee net pay checks.

-Our current thoughts are for Bookkeeping King to be available as an Android application first and then making it an iOS application.

The Bookkeeping King app will provide business owners the following features:
The ability to import all check-cash invoices and expense bills paid throughout the month into the app simply by using their phone’s camera. This is a key feature in our app because file organization is essential for all business owners and will increase productivity, reduce work stress levels, and allow easy access to all important files.


Manually import monthly revenue sales and all invoice totals into vendors of different categories of taxable (beer, liquor, soda, cigarettes, etc..) and non-taxable items (chips, groceries, water, juice, etc.…). This feature will seek to organize all data inputs into different and specific categories that make it is easy to retrieve, sort and store for future use.

Conduct an estimate of how much sales tax a business will be paying at the end of the month according to their monthly tax sales revenue and sales tax rate. This unique feature enables all business owners to understand and become aware of how much sales tax they will be paying at the end of the month. By doing this, all business owners will take into account how much money will be withdrawn from their bank accounts every month. Therefore, it will eliminate the jaw dropping moments and frustration that clients have when they hear how much sales tax they will be paying each month.

An employee paycheck calculator that computes an employee’s payroll earnings after all tax deductions. This payroll tax calculator makes it simple to handle all withholdings and deductions in California. Employers can use it to calculate net pay, figure out how much to withhold, and know how much to include in their employees’ paychecks. In addition, employers will have the ability of creating a PDF file with a breakdown of all deductions/withholdings for each employee (Check Stubs).

A virtual chatroom that enables business owners to chat with their accountant in case of any questions or emergencies. In addition, this interaction doesn't require users to sit close to a conference system speaker, making it more comfortable and user friendly.

A calendar to keep track of amid meetings and bill payments such as license renewals, sales tax, payroll tax, and lastly individual/corporate tax.
